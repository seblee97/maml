- model checkpointing doesn't seem to work (fixed maybe - test)
- plotting of priority queue scaling to parameteras
- add interpolate etc. methods for priority queue query 
- think about whether current loss metric accurately captures varying success of meta params for tasks in distribution
- make dev and exp branch
- random seeds
- figure out how to structure repos (folder for experiment scripts, folder for model scripts etc.)
