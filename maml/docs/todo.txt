Todos
- plotting of priority queue scaling to parameters
- add interpolate etc. methods for priority queue query 
- make dev and exp branch
- Make repos a package

Thoughts
- if sampling more from higher loss regions of the parameter space leads to a generally less effective meta prior, 
  in that it pushes the meta parameter to a point where it no longer initialises well for the bulk of the 'easier' tasks in the distributions, 
  how do you ensure that there are no systematic tails in the performance of the meta parameter?
- Links to fairness
- Does current loss metric accurately captures varying success of meta params for tasks in distribution

Done
- model checkpointing doesn't seem to work (fixed maybe - test)
- random seeds
- plot/log variance of meta validation loss
- figure out how to structure repos (folder for experiment scripts, folder for model scripts etc.)
- compute correlation between how often a parameter range has been picked and the loss in that grid
